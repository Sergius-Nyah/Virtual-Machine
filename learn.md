Virtual Machine
This project is a simple virtual machine that executes a set of instructions defined in an enum. The virtual machine reads a program from an array of integers and executes each instruction in sequence.

Getting Started
To get started with this project, you'll need to have a C compiler installed on your machine. We recommend using GCC or Clang.

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Sergius-Nyah/virtual-machine.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd virtual-machine
Compile the program: gcc virtual.c -o virtual
Run the program: ./virtual
Understanding the Code
The virtual.c file contains the main program code. Here's a brief overview of what each section does:

Includes
This section includes the necessary header files for the program.
<!-- #include <stdio.h>
#include <stdbool.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include "header.c" -->

Instruction Set
This section defines an enum for the instruction set. Each instruction is represented by a unique integer value.
<!-- typedef enum {
    PSH,
    ADD,
    SUB,
    MUL,
    DIV,
    MOD,
    DUP,
    SWP,
    OVR,
    POP,
    HLT
} InstructionSet; -->

Program
This section defines the program that the virtual machine will execute. The program is an array of integers, where each integer represents an instruction or an operand.
<!-- const int program[] = {
    PSH, 5,
    PSH, 6,
    ADD,
    POP,
    PSH, 10,
    DUP,
    MUL,
    POP,
    PSH, 20,
    ... -->

Main Function
This section contains the main function that executes the program. The function initializes the instruction pointer (ip), the stack pointer (sp), and the stack array (stack). It then enters a loop that reads each instruction from the program and executes it using a switch statement.
<!-- int main() {
    int ip = 0;
    int sp = -1;
    int stack[256];

    while (true) {
        InstructionSet instruction = program[ip++];

        switch (instruction) {
            case PSH:
                stack[++sp] = program[ip++];
                break;
            case ADD:
                stack[sp - 1] += stack[sp];
                sp--;
                break;
            case SUB:
                stack[sp - 1] -= stack[sp];
                sp--;
                break;
            case MUL:
                stack[sp - 1] *= stack[sp];
                sp--;
                break;
            case DIV:
                stack[sp - 1] /= stack[sp];
                sp--;
                break;
            case MOD:
                stack[sp - 1] %= stack[sp];
                sp--;
                break;
            case DUP:
                stack[sp + 1] = stack[sp];
                sp++;
                break;
            case SWP:
                swap(&stack[sp], &stack[sp - 1]);
                break;
            case OVR:
                stack[sp - 1] = stack[sp];
                sp--;
                break;
            case POP:
                sp--;
                break;
            case HLT:
                return 0;
        }
    }
} -->

Testing
To test the virtual machine, you can modify the program array in virtual.c and add your own instructions. You can also write unit tests in a separate file and include them in the project.

Conclusion
This project provides a simple example of how a virtual machine works. You can use this code as a starting point for building your own virtual machine or interpreter.
